= Ignore 

We can write multiple expressions by seperating them with semicolons `;`.

```motoko
1+1;2+2
```

For the last expression the semicolon is optional. We can add it and it will
work, we can obmit it and it will work exactly the same.

However, the example above is actually not valid.

It is expected that each expression expect the last one results in the unit type
`()`.

In our example, both expressions would result in the `Nat` type, natural number,
which means no negative numbers.

But since only the last expression is allowed to have a return type which is not
`()`, our programming won't compile.

We get:

```
expression of type Nat cannot produce expected type ()
```

We don't use the result value of the expression anyways. 

However, if we want to overcome this unit type restriction, we can do so.

Herefore we use the `ignore` keyword.

```motoko
ignore 1 + 1;
2 + 2;
```
