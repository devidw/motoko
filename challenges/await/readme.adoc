= Await

Asynchronous functions return promises, that resolve to a value, once it is
available.

We can store a promise in a variable and then wait for it later:

[source,motoko]
----
let a = someAsyncFunc();
let aResolved = await a;
----

In the above example `a` holds the promise and `aResolved` waits for the promise
to resolve and stores the resolved value.

Commonly this is done in one go:

[source,motoko]
----
let aResolved = await someAsyncFunc();
----

If we want to wait for the result of a promise in an expression that is not a
declaration, we can wrap the awaiting into brackets:

[source,motoko]
----
let isTrue = (await someAsyncFunc()) == true;
----
