= Mutable variables 

To declare mutable variables, variables those values can change, we use the
`var` keyword.

```motoko
var iAmMutable = false
```

To mutate, update a mutable variable, we use the `:=` assignment operator.

```motoko
iAmMutable := true
```

There are some special variations available depending on the variable type.

For example, we can increment a number with `+=` and append to a string with `#=`.
