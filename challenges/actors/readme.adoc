= Actors

== Internet Computer

- Canisters are memory isolated
- Canisters can communicate with asynchronous messages
- Canisters messenge candid values, the values are binary encoded
- Canisters only process one message at a time, others wait
- Canisters use callbacks to register code that needs to be done on given
message processing

== Motoko

=== General

- Actors are an abstraction/representation for canisters
- The type of the actor is its functions
- Its asynchronous functions indicate which messanges can be handled
- Types of an actor and its functions can be translated to candid
- The candid types define how the binary data passed is structured

=== Actors vs Objects

We can think of actors like sorts of objects. But there are notable differences:

- Actors come with completely isolated state
- Any interactivity with the outside goes through asynchronous messanges
- Messages are processed one-at-a-time, no matter if issued in parallel

=== Motoko Implementation

- Message sending in Motoko means calling an async function of an actor
- There is no blocking in the wait for the response, istead there is a
promise/future, that is return to the caller by the callee, that resolves, once
the message is handled
- The promise/future is a placeholder, which can result in a result
- Because there is no blocking in the time waiting for the promise to resolve,
the caller can do anything, send other requests to any actor or whatever
- The caller can wait for the result, when it resolves it will be available,
otherwise its resolved value is stored for future access

=== Shared functions and state

- Actor messanging functions are called _shared_-functions, since they can be
accessed from remote code, actors, etc.
- Shared functions return futures/promises that resolve once handled by the
called actor
- The data transmitted is immutable, we call it _shared_-state

[source,motko]
----
actor {
  public shared func someFuncName() : async Text {
    return "I am some func returning some string"
  }
}
----

Since all functions of an actor have to be shared, we can obmit the `shared`
keyword:

[source,motko]
----
actor {
  public shared func someFuncName() : async Text {
    return "I am some func returning some string"
  }
}

// Questios:

- Can multiple messanges we processed by one actor at the same time so the
one-action-per-time only applies to one messange handler
  - Or does it apply to the whole actor and therfore only one messange can be
  called at one time
