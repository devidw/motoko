= Block expressions 

We can group multiple expressions into block expressions by wrapping them into
`do {}`.

```motoko
do {
  1 + 1
}
```

The block expressions will return the result of the last expression in the
block.

The example above will result in a return value of `2`.

As with normal expressions, we can use `ignore` to overcome the errors for unused
values with a different type than `()`.

```motoko
ignore do { 1 + 1 };
do { 2 + 2 }
```

We can use expressions anywhere in our code, we can use normal expressions.

We can even nest block expressions:

```motoko
do {
  ignore do {
    1
  };
  1
}
```

The above program results in `1 : Nat`.
