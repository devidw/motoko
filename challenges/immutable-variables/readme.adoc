= Immutable variables 

We can declare immutable variables, that can't change, using the `let` keyword.

```motoko
let a = "a"
```

When we try to mutate the variable:

```motoko
let a = "a";
a := "b"
```

We end up with:

```
expected mutable assignment target
```

Which absolutely makes sense, since we tried to mutate an immutable assigment target.
